- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @louis-costa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring data visualization and programming to improve public policy.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and Python!
- âš¡ Fun fact: the first programming language I learnt, many years ago, was Turbo Pascal. We would write code on paper for assignments.
